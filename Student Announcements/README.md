# Embedding Student Announcements

This code has allowed us to embed a centralise set of "Student Announcements" into all our Canvas course pages.

## Getting Started

You will need a couple of things for this to work. You will need CanvasLMS Admin rights and the ability to upload Custom JS to your Canvas Themes.

You will also need to set up an account for Feedwind (https://feed.mikle.com/) to generate the RSS widget to display the Student News

### Prerequisites
1. Create a course that will contain your Student Announcements.
2. Have at least one Announcement created.
3. Sign up for a Feedwind account at https://feed.mikle.com/
